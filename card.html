			<p id="summary">The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior,leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
